Hi,

My name is Petro Matviichuk. Iâ€™m a [Lviv](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ukraine/western-ukraine/lviv)-based sysadmin/devops.

Currently, I'm working as DevOps Engineer at Intellias.

In this blog I write notes about daily work challenges and investigations.

So, feel free to browse, comment or share any information that might be useful for you.
