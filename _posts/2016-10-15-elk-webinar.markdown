In September I had to speak about ELK stack within [DevOps.Events](https://devops.events/) project.

It was my first webinar and I've decided to describe following topics:

* why logs are so important?
* introduction and overview of #ELK stack
* configuration example
* real-life deployment scenario

Webinar is on my native language, so if you understand Ukrainain, enjoy ;)
