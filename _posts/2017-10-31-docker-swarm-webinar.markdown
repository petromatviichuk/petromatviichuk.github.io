During fall of 2017 I was working on a project of migration existing monolithic platform to the clustered solution based on Docker containers.

Meanwhile I had opportunity to carry out [DevOps.Events](https://devops.events/) webinar. So I've decided to share my experience with Docker Swarm.

The webinar included following main topics:

* Container clustering tools
* Swarm mode overview
* Containers deployment in swarm cluster
* Demo of the deployment
